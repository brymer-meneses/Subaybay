# Parts of a Request

**Request** <br/>
An application made by a student for a specific document.

<small>e.g. a request for an OTR by Jakob Doe on March 25, 2011 </small>

## Request Type

The type of document being requested

<small>e.g. OTR, CAV, Certificate of Honorable Dismissal </small>

## Stage

A step that the request has to go through before completion.

<small>e.g. Newly Created Request, Prepare Certifiation, University Registrar Signature, Notify Requester</small>

## Current Stage

The stage . . .

## Requester

The student who submitted a request

## Handler

A member of the OUR who the request will pass through. <br/>
The handler _handles_ a particular _stage_ in the request.

A request can only at one stage at a time, so the "handler of
the **current stage**" is also the "handler of the **request**".
