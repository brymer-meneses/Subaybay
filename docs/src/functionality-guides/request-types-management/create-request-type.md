# Request Type Creation

It's important to choose a request type title carefully as **Request type titles CANNOT be renamed**.

Creating new request types is done from the **Configuration** page.

## To create a new request type
1. Input the title of the request type
2. Edit the stages of the request type
    - To add new stages, click on the `+` button at the bottom
    - To remove stages, click on the `x` button on the left side
    - To change the stage name, simply edit the input field
    - To change the default handler, click on the profile pic on the right side and select the handler from the dropdown list

The form should clear and the new request type should appear in the list of existing request types
