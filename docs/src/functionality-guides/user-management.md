# User Management
This section covers 
- adding and removing users 
- changing admin status.

All of these functions are done from the **Admin Page**. <br/>
This also means that only *admins* are allowed to do the following.

## Add User / Email
Users only need a Google Account to login. However, to prevent unauthorized access, a user's email must be added to a list of permitted emails.

**To permit a user's email**
1. Select the **Emails** tab on the top
2. Click Add User
