# Finish, Archive, and Notify

If a request was not discontinued, then it will eventually reach its Final Stage. At which point, it can be marked as finished and be removed from its handlers inboxes. Additionally, users are given the option to notify the requester via email that their request is done.
<br/><br/>

**Finishing and Archiving** requests is done from the **Inbox**. It can only be done to requests on their final stage. <br/>
When a request is on its final stage, the **Pass to Next** button in the **Inbox** should be replaced by a **Finish and Archive** button.
