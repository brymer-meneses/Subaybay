# Mark as Stale / Discontinue

In rare cases, a request can be cancelled while being processed. <br/>
To keep a complete record of all processes in the office, there is no way to delete a request without accessing the database directly.
<br/><br/>

Instead, requests can be **Marked as Stale**. This is done from the **Request Detail Page**.

_Note that only Pending requests can be marked as stale_

## To mark a request as stale

1. Click on the stacked dots and select **Mark as Stale**

![Mark as Stale 1](/request-management/stale1.png)

2. Confirm

![Mark as Stale 2](/request-management/stale2.png)

The request should now disappear from all inboxes and appear in the **Discontinued** requests list.

To mark a request as not stale, it can be [reassigned](./reassign#reassign) to a handler
