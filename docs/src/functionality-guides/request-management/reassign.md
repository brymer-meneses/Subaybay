## Reassign

Sometimes, the person meant to handle a request isn't available. Thus, there is also the option
to **Reassign** a request to another person. Additionally, **Reassigning** requests is a way to "revive" a request that was **marked as stale**.
<br/><br/>

_Note: Finished requests cannot be reassigned, only Pending and Discontinued_

Reassigning requests can be done from two locations: the **Inbox** and the **Request Details Page**.

**To reassign a request from the inbox** <br/>
_This option is only available if the request is in your_ **_Active Inbox_** <br/>
