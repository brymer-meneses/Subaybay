# Pass to Next

When there are no issues, a request only moves forward to completion.
<br/><br/>

Passing requests forward is done from the **Inbox** Page.

## To pass a request to another person

1. Select the request of interest from the **Active Inbox**
2. Click the **Pass to Next** button

3. Select the next handler
4. Confirm

Unless you choose yourself as the next handler, the request should disappear from your _Active_ inbox and appear in your _Pending_ inbox.
