# Rollback

In case mistakes are made along the process and a request needs to be brought back to a previous stage, there is the option
to **Rollback** a request.
<br/><br/>

Rolling back requests is done from the **Inbox** Page.

## To rollback a request

1. Select the request of interest from the **Pending Inbox**

4. Confirm

Unless you handled the request at multiple stages, it should disappear from your **Pending Inbox**. It should now appear in your **Active Inbox**.

Note that when a request is rolled back, it is removed from the **Pending Inbox** of all those who handled it in the in-between stages. <br/>
For example, take this request that was moved forward several times through different staff members. <br/>

```
Staff 1 > Staff 2 > Staff 3 > Staff 4
```

In this case, the request is currently in the Active Inbox of Staff 4 and the Pending Inbox of Staff 1, 2, and 3.

```
Active Inbox: Staff 4
Pending Inbox: Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3
```

If Staff 2 rolls back the request:

```
Staff 1 > Staff 2 > Staff 3 > Staff 4 > Staff 2
```

Then it will be removed from the Active Inbox of Staff 4 and the Pending Inboxes of Staff 2 and 3. Finally, it will be added to the Active Inbox of Staff 2, and the rollback will not affect Inbox of Staff 1.

```
Active Inbox: Staff 2
Pending Inbox: Staff 1
```
