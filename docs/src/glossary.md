## Parts of a Request

**Request** <br/>
An application made by a student for a specific document.

<small>e.g. a request for an OTR by Jakob Doe on March 25, 2011 </small>

**Request Type** <br/>
The type of document being requested

<small>e.g. OTR, CAV, Certificate of Honorable Dismissal </small>

**Stage** <br/>
A step that the request has to go through before completion.

<small>e.g. Newly Created Request, Prepare Certifiation, University Registrar Signature, Notify Requester</small>

**Current Stage** <br/>
The stage . . .

**Requester** <br/>
The student who submitted a request

**Handler** <br/>
A member of the OUR who the request will pass through. <br/>
The handler *handles* a particular *stage* in the request.

A request can only at one stage at a time, so the "handler of
the **current stage**" is also the "handler of the **request**".

## Procedures on requests

**Reassign** <br/>
Change the handler of a request's current stage.

A request can only at one stage at a time, so phrases like "reassign a **request**" and "reassign a **stage**"
can be used interchangeably

**Rollback** <br/>
Move a request backwards to a previous stage.

**Pass / Pass to Next** <br/>
Finish a stage and move a request forward, to the next handler

When referring to *stages*, the term "finish" has the same meaning as "pass to next" <br/>
<small>
Note that "<em>passing</em> a request" specifically refers to moving it forward,
other terms are provided for moving it backwards or changing handler
</small>

**Finish (request)** <br/>
Complete a request. The request should be archived right after

When referring to requests, the phrase "fully finish" may be used, but it has the same meaning as "finish"
