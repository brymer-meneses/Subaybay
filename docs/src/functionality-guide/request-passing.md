# Request Passing
A request can move around a lot.

When there are no issues, a request only moves forward. This means that for the most part, the only 
necessary functionality is the **Pass to Next** option.

However, sometimes, the person meant to handle a request isn't available. Thus, there is also the option
to **Reassign** a request to another person.

In case mistakes are made along the process and request needs to be brought back, there is the option
to **Rollback** a request.
